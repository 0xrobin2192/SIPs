# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to update the USDT perps v2 parameters as per the below:
- `maxPD` updated from 15 bp to 30 bp
- `maxLiqudiationDelta` update from 30 bp to 15 bp

# Abstract

maxPD (MPD) and maxLiquidationDelta (MLD) are parameters introduced in [SIP-2005](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2005/) and they are set by governance taking into account the below rules:
- maxPD is set to 2 * (offchain maker fee + offchain taker fee)
- maxLiquidationDelta is set to offchain maker + offchain taker fees

These parameters did not respect the above rule of thumb in [SIP-2030](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2030/), which might result in more endorsed liquidations then necessary.

# Motivation

The main motivation is to align the `maxPD` and `maxLiquidationDelta` parameters in terms of setting across all markets.
