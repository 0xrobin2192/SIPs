# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to lower the `maxTokenAmount` on the wETH wrapper on optimism to zero.

# Abstract

The `maxTokenAmount` is the maximum amount that can be wrapped at any point.

# Motivation 

The primary motivation is the lack of need for capacity on that wrapper in the near to medium term, due to the abundance of synth liquidity on AMM.
