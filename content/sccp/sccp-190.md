## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SCCP proposes to raise the XAU futures market `MaxMarketValueUSD` from sUSD 1M to 5M. 

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The XAU market's OI is at its limit for a while on organic usage, and can be raised from its initial limit. 

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The market is at its OI limit for a few days already now, which means that there's high community demand. 

Safety considerations:
- Market pausing automation is operational and has paused and resumed the market successfully already.
- There were no FR incidents in this market.
- Market PnL looks healthy.
