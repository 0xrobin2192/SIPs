## Simple Summary

The SCCP proposes to redeem `0xb84acf5af9132680876ccef334f7d6f8b4599c16` at parity. This is done by increasing the `discountRate` to 1, executing the redemption on the sBTC held by the user and setting discount rate to 60%. 

# Abstract

The `discountRate` is the rate described in [SIP-2059](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2059/) that determines the rate which users can redeem their synths for sUSD.

## Motivation

The `discountRate`, currently set to 75%, in order to encourages holders to redeem their volatile synths to sUSD. However, users who held volatile legacy synths, since before SIP-2059 was executed, can request from governance to be redeemed at parity. It is important to note that snx stakers debt should not increase after this transaction is executed.
