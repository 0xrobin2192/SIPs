# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to decrease the dynamic redeemer to 0.75 from 0.90.

# Abstract

`discountRate` as per [SIP-2059](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2059/), the `discountRate` is used to compute the sUSD value of synth debt as well as determines the return on redemption of spot synths. 

# Motivation

The primary motivation is to move forward the intended design of [SIP-2059](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2059/) is increasing the incentives on users to migrate their synths over into sUSD.
