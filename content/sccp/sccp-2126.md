# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to increase the `issuanceRatio` on SNX Staking back to 500% or 20% in `issuanceRatio` terms.

# Abstract

The issuance ratio is the ratio that determines the maximum amount of sUSD that can be minted for a staked amount of snx collateral.


# Motivation

The min cratio was recently lowered via an emergency decision as per [SCCP-2122](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-2122/) although the author of this sccp continues to question the effectiveness of that SCCP in safeguarding the system, this SCCP proposes to reset the staking ratio back to previous levels.
