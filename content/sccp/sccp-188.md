## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SCCP proposes to alter the SNX inflationary distribution ratio from 30% Optimism 70% Ethereum Mainnet to 50% Optimism 50% Ethereum Mainnet

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

In order to further incentivize minters to shift their holdings to L2, this SCCP proposes to increase the inflationary rewards distribution in Optimism Stakers favor.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

This SCCP aims to further incentivize minters to move their stack to L2. All new Synthetix products, assets, and partners are all on Optimism and generating volume on Optimism. 

There is clear consensus in the community for this change, apparent in the gov call chat channel, as most of the Synthetix trading volume occurs on layer two.
