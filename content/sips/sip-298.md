## Simple Summary

Create Synthetix Perps V2 markets for GOLD, SILVER, and OIL
## Abstract

This is a proposal to offer GOLD-PERP, SILVER-PERP, and OIL-PERP futures which track the price of their respective commodity.

## Motivation

GOLD, SILVER, and OIL are three of the most traded commodities in the world. It is important to expand the supported markets for Synthetix Perps outside of Cryptocurrencies, to attract new users, usecases, and volume.

## Rationale

Adding commodities to Synthetix Perps expands the number of perp markets available, and allows Synthetix Perps to expand to an entirely new market offering. Not only will this benefit Synthetix, it will also open up opportunities for the entire Synthetix Ecosystem with additional financial products being built ontop of these commodity perps offerings.

The market depth and volume for these three commodities reasonably poses no risk with regards to price manipulation given the market's size.

## Specification

Gold (XAU) perp market will be priced from aggregating 1 oz of gold via Pyth Network (with Chainlink as a backup)

Silver (XAG) perp market will be priced by aggregating 1 oz of silver via Pyth Network (with Chainlink as a backup)

OIL (OIL) perp market will be priced by aggregating 1 barrel of non-expiring Crude Oil Index based on ICE Brent Crude Oil via Pyth Network (with Chainlink as a backup)

All three of these markets experience market closure and other real world trading trading stoppages (circuit breakers). During these times, markets will be closed and unavaible to trade.

## Technical Specification

Implementation requires implementing off-chain oracle price feeds from Pyth Network and backup on-chain oracles from Chainlink.

Open Interest Caps and Fees will be configurable for each token independently via SCCP, but the initial open interest caps will be as follows:

| Open Interest Cap 	| Native Price   	| Approximate USD Value 	|
|-------------------	|----------------	|-----------------------	|
| GOLD OI CAP:       	| 260             | (~500K USD)           	|
| SILVER OI CAP:      | 21,000      	  | (~500K USD)           	|
| OIL OI CAP:      	  | 5,700     	    | (~500K USD)           	|
