## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes incorporating a cooldown window when accounts wish to exit or decrease their delegated collateral to a given market. After a user signals intention to decrease his delegated collateral, a configurable duration needs to be awaited (`cooldownDuration`). Once the cool down duration lapses, the user has configurable `cooldownWindow` to execute the delegation decrease action. In case the user fails to execute delegation decrease action during the `cooldownWindow`, the latter expires and the user will need to perform another delegation decrease intent.

An account who signaled his intent to decrease his delegation on a given market cannot increase his delegated to that market during the `cooldownDuration` period. However, the account can signal multiple decreases of staked collateral on different markets simultaneously. Once a user signals his intention to reduce his delegated collateral on a specific market, he cannot schedule another reduction to the  delegated collateral on that same market until the previous intent is executed or is expired.
In case a users' collateral is liquidated, all the accounts' cooldown intents are revoked.

The `cooldownDuration` and `cooldownWindow`  are both configurable per market. Markets that do not require this intent/execute pattern can have this feature disabled by setting `cooldownDuration` to zero. 

Note that a user can signal an intent, but cannot execute that intent, if the `minDelegateTime` specified in [SIP-320](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-320/) had not lapsed.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

In Perp V3, liquidation of the margin and position could take place at different speeds, depending on the liquidity of token, the size of the position or margin and  the rate limit configured. This difference in timing could lead to a situation where the profit/loss impact becomes deterministic. Therefore, in order to ensure that liquidity providers are fairly compensated for their delegated liquidity, a cool off period is proposed when undelegating liquidity from a given market.  


## Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

This functionality is intended to add friction in removing / decreasing a users' delegated collateral in order to lean against behavior of taking advantage of deterministic changes P&L impact from liquidations that are yet to be fully executed.

## Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

- `cooldownDuration` is a configurable number of seconds that determines the minimum duration before an intent can be executed.
- `setCooloffDuration(int128)` to the `IMarketManager` interface that allows a market to associate a cool off duration with a market.
- `cooldownWindow` is a configurable number of seconds that determines the maximum amount of time an intent is executed after the `cooldownDuration` lapses.
- `setCooldownWindow(int128)` to the `IMarketManager` interface that allows a market to associate a cool off window with a market.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

- Setting the `cooldownDuration` to 12 hours, `cooldownWindow` to 6 hours
  - When a random account, with delegated liquidity to the perp super market attempts to signal an intent to undelegate his liquidity
    - ✅ Then the transaction succeeds
      - After the `cooloffDuration` and `minDelegateTime` lapse
        - the user attempts to execute the intent in the `cooldownWindow`
          - ✅ Then the transaction succeeds  and the users' delegated liquidity is reduced
        - the user attempts to execute the intent after the `cooldownWindow` lapses
          - ❌ Then transaction reverts, as the `cooldown` intent had expired 
      - Before the `cooloffDuration` lapses
        - the user attempts to execute the intent
          - ❌ Then transaction reverts, as the `cooloffDuration` had not lapsed
      - The user attempts to delegate more collateral to the perp supermarket
          - ❌ Then transaction reverts, due to a cooldown intent being signalled by the user
      - The user attempts to undelegate more collateral from the perp supermarket
          - ❌ Then transaction reverts, due to a cooldown intent already being signalled by the user
      - The user gets liquidated before the `minDelegateTime` and `cooloffDuration` has lapsed 
          - ✅ Then the transaction succeeds and the `cooloff` intent is revoked
      - After the `cooloffDuration` lapse but before the `minDelegateTime` has lapsed
        - the user attempts to execute the intent in the `cooldownWindow` the user attempts to execute the intent
          - ❌ Then transaction reverts, due to the `minDelegateTime` not having lapsed
