## Simple Summary

This SIP ends inflation with the total SNX supply capped at 300m tokens.

## Abstract

This SIP caps the supply of SNX at 300m tokens and elevates the token supply to metagovernance status, requiring a unanimous vote by the council in order to modify the token supply. The inflaion for the current fee period has already been minted raising the total supply to 293,251,260.7987736034469344 tokens. Inflation will run for a further ten fee periods with 674873.920122639655307 tokens minted each week until the total supply reaches 300,000,000. 

## Motivation

Inflation was intended to bootstrap the network and it has done this extremely effectively. Now that fee yield from atomic swaps and perps is meaningful and growing it is time to wind down inflation, the fact that we are only a few weeks away from the very memeable 300 million mark is cause enough to make this change.

## Specification

1. The total supply will be fixed at 300m.
2. The inflationary rewards in the current period will be distributed (~2m SNX)
3. A further 6,748,739.201226396553066 tokens will be minted over the following ten weeks.
4. The total supply of SNX will be controlled by metagovernance, requiring a unanimous vote to modify it further.

### Overview

Inflation was introduced in 2019 in order to help bootstrap the network, following the pivot from Havven to Synthetix, it is fair to say this was a far more successful change than anyone anticipated. When inflation was introduced it was set to run for four years ending in march 2023 with a fixed supply of ~250m SNX. There were several SIPs introduced subsequently to modify the inflation schedule, this resulted most recently in a much higher rate of inflation, but higher inflation did not meaningfully impact the percentage of SNX staked in the network so a decision was made to reduce inflation, and with this SIP to eliminate it entirely.

### Rationale

The community has attempted to tweak inflationary incentives a number of times over the years and while these changes have often been succesasful inflation itself distorts the incentives within the network. On one hand inflation redistributes more ownership of the network to those who stake, it decreases the dollar denominated fee yield (paid in sUSD) per SNX over time. The issue with this is that it creates fundamental and constant downward pressure on the price. This is particularly true today as even though inflationary rewards are locked for a year it is trivially easy to hedge this exposure by continuously selling unlocked SNX. By fixing the supply at 300m we ensure that the sUSD fee yield per SNX will grow as protocol revenue grows, this should assist with attempts to analyse the value of the SNX token using various cash flow models. Also the 300 meme is too good to pass up.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->
