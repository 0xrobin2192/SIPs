## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SIP proposes the following:

A) Drop the `acceptablePrice` check on order commitment

B) Use available on-chain price, without staleness tolerance, when `settleOrder` calls `requiredCredit`

C) Incorporate a market specific `FeatureFlag` into a perp supermarket

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

A) [`acceptablePriceExceeded`](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/3912d2f61dd6c7f7c29e750b7f116804027b0965/markets/perps-market/contracts/storage/AsyncOrder.sol#L302) is thrown whenever the limit price is worse than the users' `fillPrice` upon order commitment and settle. As per ERC-7421, integrators are required to push for a fresh price update when the staleness error is thrown. However, the concept of `acceptablePrice` requires a fresh price to be included upon commitment with no error thrown, as the chain is not able to tell whether an acceptable limit price is far from the one available on chain. Hence removing this check, on commitment is necessary in order to simplify the order execution pattern for integrators and decrease the gas cost associated with order execution.

B) [SIP-354](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-354) introduced a requirement that all markets, in a given supermarket, are not in a stale state, upon order settlement. This cause issues, given that keepers are compensated for updating 1 price per order. Furthermore, when a user commits to an order, staleness is only checked against the position being altered.  This SIP proposes to drop tolerance check requirements when [settleOrder](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/434b685c49db22ddc24cffa07a6b3fbfb8f0df17/markets/perps-market/contracts/modules/AsyncOrderSettlementPythModule.sol#L46) calls [requiredCredit](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/9b410c97cc1afee9c0c0c4ced5a1e652369bf36f/markets/perps-market/contracts/storage/PerpsMarket.sol#L431C77-L431C86). Note that all other calls to the `requiredCredit` function remain the same with respect to staleness tolerance.

C) Currently, a perp supermarket can be disabled with a `FeatureFlag` function. However, finer grained control over a supermarket might be needed in situations where one of the markets needs to be individually disabled by governance. This sip proposes to incorporate a specialized `FeatureFlag` that suspends a perp market in a given supermarket. In case a given perp market is set to disabled, then all accounts that hold a position in a suspended market, have all their interaction access rights disabled, while all other users are not impacted by the suspension.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The motivation of this sip, is to incorporate requests from CC's and integrators into Perps V3 in order to allow it to be integrated smoothly within the different frameworks.
