## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SIP proposes the following:

A) Drop the `acceptablePrice` check on order commitment

B) Use available on-chain price, without staleness tolerance, when `settleOrder` calls `requiredCredit`

C) Incorporate per market `FeatureFlag` into a supermarket

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

A) [`acceptablePriceExceeded`](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/3912d2f61dd6c7f7c29e750b7f116804027b0965/markets/perps-market/contracts/storage/AsyncOrder.sol#L302) is thrown whenever the limit price is worse than the users' `fillPrice` on order commitment. This check is run on both settlement and order commitment. This SIP proposes to drop the check on commitment, in order to simplify the order commitment pattern, where price updates are only needed when prices are considered to be stale as per the specified staleness tolerance. 

B) [SIP-354](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-354) introduced a requirement that all markets be not stale upon order settlement. This could cause issues, given that keepers are compensated for executing 1 order and updating 1 price. This SIP proposes to drop tolerance check requirements when [settleOrder](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/434b685c49db22ddc24cffa07a6b3fbfb8f0df17/markets/perps-market/contracts/modules/AsyncOrderSettlementPythModule.sol#L46) calls [requiredCredit](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/blob/9b410c97cc1afee9c0c0c4ced5a1e652369bf36f/markets/perps-market/contracts/storage/PerpsMarket.sol#L431C77-L431C86). Note that any other calls to the `requiredCredit` function would still require a price update.

C) Currently, a perp supermarket can be disabled with a `FeatureFlag` function. However, finer grained control ovver a supermarket might be required in situations where one of the markets incorporated into the supermarket need to be disabled. This sip proposes to incorporate a specialized `FeatureFlag` that suspends a perp super market provided a given target market. Note that all other markets are expected to be able to function normally in that situation, with order commitments, order settlement, liquidations, deposits and withdrawals taking place without issue.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The motivation of this sip, is to incorporate requests from CC's and integrators into Perps V3 in order to allow it to be integrated smoothly within the different frameworks.
