## Abstract
SIP 334 proposes enhancing the Oracle Manager in the Synthetix protocol to support custom bytes data in requests, enabling graph nodes to alter outcomes based on the provided information. This upgrade opens up new possibilities for use cases, such as the Perps market implementation, and ensures greater flexibility and accuracy in the Synthetix ecosystem.

## Motivation

The current Oracle Manager in the Synthetix protocol does not allow the inclusion of custom bytes data in requests. This limitation restricts the flexibility of the system and prevents certain use cases that require additional information to be passed to the graph nodes. By enhancing the Oracle Manager to support custom data, developers and users can leverage this feature for various purposes, including the upcoming Perps market implementation.

## Specification

The proposed upgrade involves modifying the NodeModule of the oracle manager proxy to add an overloaded function for the process() solidity external function. The new function signature will be as follows:

```
function process(bytes32 nodeId, bytes calldata customData) external;
```

The existing process() function will continue to operate as before for regular oracle price requests without the custom data.

When a request is made with the enhanced process() function and includes customData, the Oracle Manager will pass this data to the graph nodes along with the usual oracle price information. This enables the graph nodes to utilize the custom data while executing the request and alter the outcome based on the provided information.

### Use Case: Perps Markets

One significant use case for this enhancement is the upcoming implementation of the Perps market. By including data about the size of the trade in the request, the graph nodes can compare this data with current reported exchange depths and adjust the ultimate fill price accordingly. This additional data is helpful for better pricing of trades in the Perps market.
