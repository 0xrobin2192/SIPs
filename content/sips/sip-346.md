## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes replacing the minimum collateral delegation duration specified in [SIP-320](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-320/) with a different design that entails stakers signaling an intention to remove / decrease their delegated collateral on given market and decentralized bots being able to execute that intention after a configurable duration. Bots would receive a configurable keeper fee (in sUSD) which needs to be paid upfront from stakers collateral. 
The intent is non-revokable and during that time window, except via a liquidation. Furthremore, if an account signals an intention to remove / decrease his delegate collateral, he cannot add in the market until the intent is executed or revoked via liquidation.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

In Perp V3 markets during liquidations, the collateral and positions could unwind at different speeds, depending on the liquidity of assets and the rate limiting imposed on each. This difference in timing could have predicatable impacts on the liquidity providers profitability. Therefore, in order to ensure that all providers are fairly compensated for their delegated liquidity this intent / execute pattern is proposed.  


## Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

This functionality is intended to achieve a similar effect as the "burn lock" on the Synthetix V2 protocol, except that the burn lock timer is initiated by the user and executed by a keeper after a configurable time.

## Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

- Add a `lastConfigurationTime` timestamp associated with the pool and a `lastDelegationTime` mapping of an account ID to a timestamp.
- Add `setMarketMinDelegateTime(uint128 marketId, uint minDelegateTime)` to the `IMarketManager` interface that allows a market to associate a `minDelegateTime` with the market. Revert if this value is greater than `setMarketMinDelegateTime_max`.
- When `setPoolConfiguration` is called, it takes the maximum of all the `minDelegateTime` value for all of the markets its backing and it reverts if `block.timestamp` minus this value is greater than the `lastConfigurationTime`.
- When `delegateCollateral` is called, it takes the maximum of all the `minDelegateTime` value for all of the markets its pool is backing and it reverts if `block.timestamp` minus this value is greater than the `lastDelegationTime`.
- After the `setPoolConfiguration` and `delegateCollateral` function is called (in all cases), `lastConfigurationTime` and `lastDelegationTime` are updated to be `block.timestamp`, respectively.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Relevant tests will be developed during implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

- `setMarketMinDelegateTime_max` (uint32) - Markets cannot set a `minDelegateTime` to a value greater than this. This can be updated with the `setConfig` function.
