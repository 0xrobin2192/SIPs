## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes incorporating an intent & execute pattern for accounts wishing to exit or decrease their delegated collateral to a given market. The execution of the intent is a public function that can be performed by any account or keeper, who receives a configurable compensation (in sUSD) for executing the intent. The `cooloffKeeperFee` is set aside from the users' account at intent.
After a user signals intention to decrease his delegated collateral, a configurable duration needs to be awaited (`cooloffDuration`), before execution of the intent can be performed.

The intent is non-revokable and during the cool-off time period, the account cannot increase his delegation to the market on which cool off is enacted. However, the account can schedule consecutive intents to decrease their staked collateral on different markets, as long as the number of scheduled intents from a account is below `maxCoolOffs` (a configurable value).
In case a users' collateral is liquidated during the cool-off period, all the accounts scheduled intents are revoked.

It is important to mention that a user can only initiate the intent to decrease his delegation, after the minimum delegation period (`minDelegateTime`), described in [SIP-320](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-320/) runs out.

Finally, the cool off period is configurable per market, given that markets that do not require this intent/execute pattern, the cool off window can be set to zero resulting in immediate removal of delegated liquidity, forbearing that `minDelegateTime` had run out.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

In Perp V3, liquidation of the margin and position could take place at different speeds, depending on the liquidity of token, the size of the position or margin and  the rate limit configured. This difference in timing could lead to a situation where the profit/loss impact becomes deterministic during time of increased price volatility. Therefore, in order to ensure that liquidity providers are fairly compensated for their delegated liquidity this intent / execute pattern is proposed.  


## Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

This functionality is intended to add friction in removing / decreasing a users' delegated collateral in order to lean against behavior of taking advantage of deterministic changes P&L impact from liquidations that are yet to be fully executed.

## Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

- `maxCooloffs` is a configurable number of cool offs an account can schedule at a given point of time, across all markets delegated into.
- `setMaxCoolOff(int32)` to the `IPoolModule` interface that allows a pool to configure a maximum number of of cool offs by a given account.
- `cooloffDuration` is a configurable number of seconds that determines the minimum duration before an intent can be executed.
- `setCooloffDuration(int128)` to the `IMarketManager` interface that allows a market to associate a cool off duration with a market.
- `coolOffKeeperFee` is a configurable amount of sUSD, paid to the caller for executing a delegation removal.
- `setCoolOffKeeperFee(int256)` to the `IPoolModule` interface that allows to configure the keeper fee at the pool level.
- `coolOffs` is a mapping from `account id` to an array of tuples. Each tuple contains the address of the market, the timestamp of intent and the intended amount of delegation to be decreased.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
