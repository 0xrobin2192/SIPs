## Abstract

This SIP proposes a minor change to Synthetix V3 which effects the stablecoin issuance system. Rather than minting stablecoins into the wallet of the address which calls the function, stablecoins will be minted into the core system and associated with the relevant account. They can then be withdrawn like collateral, using the `withdraw` function.

## Motivation

In anticipation of the implementation of cross-chain pools, the Synthetix protocol will need a way to issue stablecoins but disallow users to withdraw until a timeout expires, such that information pertaining to pool debt can be syncronized across chains. Because we anticipate this requirement and this may be an interface-breaking change, we believe it should be incorporated into a protocol upgrade as soon as possible.

Further, because the `withdraw` function respects the withdraw timeout (outlined in SIP-316) there is an added security improvement here. If an attacker were able to somehow associate collateral with their account, without this upgrade, they could circumvent the withdrawal timeout by minting stablecoins against it.

## Specification

In the IssueUSD Module, the stablecoins should be minted to the core system address rather than `msg.sender` and then associated with the relevant account (as collateral is during a call to `deposit`).

The stablecoin will always need to be withdrawable, but should not be accepted as collateral by pools by default.
