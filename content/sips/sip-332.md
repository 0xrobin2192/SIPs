## Abstract

SIP-332 proposes a minor change to Synthetix v3 that changes the existing functionality of the sUSD mint system. It only allows users to mint sUSD tokens directly into the Core System Account Deposit System. This change is essential to facilitate the future release of cross-chain pools and to enhance the security of the core system against potential hacker attacks by introducing a withdrawal timeout.

## Motivation

The current Synthetix v3 system allows for a user to mint/burn sUSD tokens for a pool directly from their own wallet account.

The proposed change will instead mint sUSD tokens to their user account. An account can still be used

## Specification

1. Minting sUSD Tokens into the Core System Account Deposit System
   - The existing function, `mint` will be altered to deposit into a user's account

2. Burning sUSD Tokens from the Core System Account Deposit System
   - The existing function, `burn` will be altered to deposit into a user's account

## Rationale

The proposed changes are essential to prepare the Synthetix v3 protocol for the release of cross-chain pools. By enabling users to directly mint and burn sUSD tokens into the Core System Account Deposit System, we can introduce additional limitations preventing a user from fully withdrawing the funds until their action has been propogated to other chains.

Furthermore, introducing a withdrawal timeout enhances the core system's security and resilience against potential vulnerabilities. This measure provides a window of opportunity to detect and respond to any suspicious activities, protecting user funds and the overall integrity of the system.
