## Simple Summary

This SIP proposes a new plan for SNX Inflationary Staking Rewards for both L1 and L2  

## Abstract

Reduce inflationary SNX staking rewards by 1% each week until the target of 20% yearly inflation is reached and then maintain that with weekly readjustments  

## Motivation

SIP-202 introduced inflation increases based on % of SNX staked. During a period of 3 months, inflations has gone from 300k SNX a week to more than 2 million SNX a week. Unfortunately, the percentange of SNX staked has not seen a tangible improvement, but it could be argued that 202 has stopped further decreases in amount of SNX staked. SIP-202 was paused by spartan council pausing the inflation at a seemingly random number of a bit more than 2 million SNX per week.      
Current yearly inflation is at about 45% of total circulating supply, inclusive of escrowed rewards. Considering that about 60-70% of SNX is staked, the staking APR on SNX rewards alone is usually above 100%.      

Since the futures functionality was released it has brought an increase of sUSD fees to stakers with debt stabilisation - approaching neutral thus far. Last few weeks atomic swaps have seen a large adoption due to 1inch aggregation. Between futures and atomic swaps the sUSD staking APR has seen 7-10% last few weeks.     

With the above in mind, drafters believe that the high inflation, which would double the total SNX supply in less than 2 years, is more than required.      
Drafters believe that a targeted 20% yearly inflation, presumably into perpetuity absent further SC action, that readjusts weekly based on total circulating supply, is an appropriate target.  Compared to SIP-202, this should require less labor from the pDAO, and be thus less susceptible to implementation and maintenance errors.  This outcome should therefore also be more aligned with a greater decentralised status for the operation of the protocol.  
The decline in weekly inflation will be iterative with steps of 1% a week until the target of 20% yearly inflation is reached that readjusts on a weekly level, as laid out in specification section.    


## Specification

Current total supply of SNX per coingecko (at the time of writing the SIP) is 266,473,982 with inflation being close to 2 million SNX.  

The SNX inflation shall be reduced by 1% until the target of 20% yearly inflation is reached. It will take roughly a year for inflation to hit that threshold.    
 
Once hit, the new formula to calculate weekly inflation should be:  

`(totalSupply*1.2 - totalsupply)/52`  

This makes for 20% yearly APR assuming all SNX is staked, or 22.09% APY, thus the actual yearly inflation at any given time is **22.09%**.  
 
The intent is to not have any manual weekly transaction to readjust inflation, but rather codify the above iterative reduction until the target is reached, and then use the new formula.  

### Test Cases

N/A

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

`Yearly Inflation rate multiplier` = 1.2
