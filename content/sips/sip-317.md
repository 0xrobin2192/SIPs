## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes a spot market implementation, issuing ERC-20 tokens that can be exchanged for snxUSD at a rate determined by a price feed plus or minus fees.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The spot market implementation outlined below will allow anyone to create a synthetic asset by specifying a price feed, an optional contract address which calculates fees, and other configurable settings.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Rather than consolidating all spot synth exchange functionality into a single system, the V3 architecture allows us to encapsulate logic for markets into seperate systems. This modular architecture allows for more rapid experimentation and iteration for configurable aspects of particular assets (like fee structures) while still being able to re-use core logic across all spot markets.

Note that markets exist outside of core system and, therefore, are generally not within the scope of governance. In this case, the market implementation proposed relies on the [market-provided collateral](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-256/) feature to maximize scalability, so governance should approve of the market's mechanism and future upgrades.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

The proposed implementation involves core spot market logic, optional rebasing functionality on the token, and fee calculator contracts.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

This implementation is essentially a factory, with the ability to generate new assets with a single function call. A major benefit of this approach is that users can create and configure markets without needing to deploy smart contracts themselves. If this implementation is upgraded in the future, all assets created in this way will benefit from the upgrade.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

#### Buying & Selling

The market module will implement the following functions:

- `function buy(uint amountUsd)` - This takes the amount of snxUSD provided, applies fees, and converts it to an amount of synthetic assets to mint.
- `function sell(uint sellAmount)` - This takes the amount of synthetic assets provided, applies fees, and converts it to an amount of snxUSD to withdraw.
- `function reportedDebt(uint128 marketId)` - This returns the total supply of synths multiplied by the current price.

#### Wrapping

A market can optionally specify an address for an ERC-20 _equivalent asset_. This asset should be an accepted collateral type on the core protocol, and this particular market should be permitted to deposit it with the [Market-provided Collateral](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-308/) functionality. The enables the following functions:

- `function wrap(uint amount)` - Deposit the `amount` of equivalent assets into the protocol and issue the same amount of synthetic assets, after applying a fee.
- `function unwrap(uint amount)` - Withdraw the `amount` of equivalent assets into the protocol and burn the same amount of synthetic assets, after applying a fee.

#### Auto-Rebalancing Skew

In addition to any fee calculators that a market may want to implement, the following fee structure would create an _auto-rebalancing skew_, allowing a market to use wrapping functionality in such a way that reduces protocol risk. A (positive or negative) fee could be applied as a function of _market skew_, defined as the total supply of synths minus the amount of wrapped collateral. Similar to the mechanism outlined in [SIP-279](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-279/), this creates an arbitrage opportunity that will pull the skew back into a tolerance range defined by the function.

#### Supply Targets

Another potential fee calculator could enforce a _supply target_ (a configurable amount of synths) which helps limit backers' exposure to price fluctuations of the asset in situations where demand becomes very high. A _utilization rate_ could be calculated as the ratio between the market skew and the supply target. If the utilization rate exceeds 100% a fee could be applied when buying the asset (and this fee could scale up with any increase to the utilization rate).

#### Locking

To reduce risk to synth holders and stakers, the market could also [lock](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-309/) an amount of collateral as a function of the utilization rate.

#### Interest Rate

Synths could also configure an interest rate, implemented as a rebase token. The interest rate could be a configured as a fixed percentage, a function of the utilization rate, or a combination of both.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Relevant tests will be developed during implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
