## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intend to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This proposal aims to improve the coordination of protocol development. 

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This proposal outlines four key changes to how development is organized: (a) transferring the protocol roadmap responsibility to the Core Contributor Committee (CCC), (b) establishing a regular funding schedule for Core Contributors (CCs) by the Treasury Council (TC), (c) enabling governance participation in electing CCC members, and (d) formalizing a dedicated support role to the CCC.



## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

The current process for the Synthetix protocol roadmap, managed by the Spartan Council following [SIP-232](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-232/), has not been effective. A clear and accountable governance structure is needed for the protocolâ€™s milestones.

The funding process for Core Contributors, initiated by [SIP-155](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-155/), lacks a formal schedule, leading to an unclear cadence.

Finally, the governance of Core Contributors is currently isolated from token holder influence, resulting in a disconnect between the largest capital allocation and token holder interests.

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

**Protocol Roadmap:** 
The CCC will be responsible for the protocol roadmap, and monthly updates with the TC and Spartan Council (SC). The CCC will propose a draft roadmap at the start of each governance epoch for SC approval, and provide updates at the epoch's end. Decision-making for the roadmap content rests with the SC.

**CC Funding:**
The CCC will prepare a detailed budget aligned with the roadmap, for TC review and funding. Funding will be provided each governance epoch, ensuring a minimum operational runway of three months.

**CCC Appointment:** 
The process for electing CCC members will change. The CCs will elect one member as part of the existing CCC election schedule in March and September. The SC and TC will each be able to elect or appoint one member, from the CCs or their respective councils. If the SC and TC do not choose to appoint a CCC member, the seat will remain vacant.

**CCC Support:** 
Formalize a support role to the CCC, responsible for implementing its decisions, and coordinating with the other governance bodies. This role exists informally already, but will be expanded to include coordination with SC and TC on budget and roadmap.

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

**Protocol Roadmap:** Assigning roadmap responsibility to the CCC addresses the current governance gap and ensures alignment between protocol resources and governance decisions.

**TC Funding:** Establishing a regular funding schedule by the TC ensures continuous protocol development, gives CCs confidence in operational security, and aligns capital allocation with milestones.

**CCC Appointment:** Changing the CCC election process will enhance accountability and transparency, by including the tokenholder-elected SC and TC. 
Appointing a single Lead Contributor instead of a CCC is another way to increase accountability and transparency, but could lead to centralization risk. Instead, allowing the SC and TC the option to appoint CCC seats satisfies the governance issues identified, without the high dependency on a single person.

**CCC Support:**
Formalizing the support role removes an ambiguity about who is responsible for implementation of CCC decisions, and coordinating with the SC and TC. This responsibility is already being filled informally, and This proposal is proposing a formalization of the responsibilities currently being filled informally, not a personnel change. 

### Test Cases
