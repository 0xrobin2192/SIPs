## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->
This SIP establishes the Aelin project.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->
This SIP proposes the creation of the Aelin Protocol, this protocol is an open and permissionless factory contract that enables anyone to instantiant a pool of captial that can be used to source deals within the crypto space.

## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->
Aelin is a new decentralised deal coordination protocol. This SIP leverages the established decentralised governance framework of Synthetix to launch this new protocol in a fair and transparent manner. A portion of the AELIN tokens will be distributed to SNX stakers as a sign of appreciation for the effort that has gone into establishing Synthetix governance, and allowing the Aelin Protocol to utilise this governance framework.
Establishing a new protocol and community is a challenging poposition, there are very few examples of projects that have been fair launched and have managed to become self-sustaining. By leveraging the exisiting Synthetix governance system and rewarding SNX stakers Aelin will be able to create a new open governence process that inhereits the legitimacy of Synthetix governance. The decision to leverage Synthetix goverance relied on the past success of Thales and Kwenta in establishing indepent communities centered around a new ptotocol launched by the Synthetix community.


## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
The Aelin contracts have been written by a team of volunteer engineers, the contracts will be deployed once this SIP has been approved by the Spartan Council. The purpose of these contracts is to create a new protocol that satisifies this high level specification. Aelin enables (a Sponsor) to create a pool that anyone can deposit funds into. In exchange for their deposit they get a token representing a claim on the pool of funds. The sponsor then structures a deal with a counterparty (the Holder). The Sponsor and the Holder formalise the deal terms in a Deal Contract. Once the terms are finalised, conversions are enabled in between the pool contract and the deal contract. aePool token holders can choose to redeem their aePool tokens for the underlying funds in the pool, rejecting the deal terms. Alternatively, they can redeem their aePool tokens under the terms of the deal. The protocol collects a fixed percentage of each deal determined by protocol governance, 2% initially. The Sponsor can also elect to capture a percentage of the deal in addition to this protocol fee. In both cases, these fees are paid using tokens at the prevailing deal terms.

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
Over the last few years the crypto fundraising process has matured significantly. We see far fewer huge pre-product raises, with most seed rounds being in the low single digit millions. The issue is that this means it is almost impossible for the wider community to participate in early stage projects. There are solutions such as LBPs by Balancer and other projects, but Aelin will allow for a project to launch a new token with a fixed outcome in mind in terms of valuation without needing to negotiate with thousands of people or relying on a market driven mechanism that may result in a high variable outcome. With Aelin a pre-token project with be able to find a sponsor with a pool of funds that meets their funding needs and negotiate a resonable valuation with vesting terms that ensure long term alignment. Additionally for established projects OTC deals to generate treasury liquidity will be possible that result in much wider token distribution.

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->
Factory Contract
The factory contracts allow anyone to initialise a new aePool contract and then a Deal Contract.

aePool Contracts have the following variables:
Purchase Currency (Dai, sUSD, USDC, ETH, WBTC, etc)
Capped (Bool)
Cap in currency if yes
If uncapped then pro-rata or first come first served (gas war mode aka MEV mode)
Duration: period after which aePool tokens can be redeemed for the underlying assets
Sponsor Fee %

Deal Contracts have the following variables:
Deal Currency (YFI, SNX, AAVE, UNI, CRV, essentially any ERC-20 token)
Deal Ratio (Deal Currency/Purchase Currency Ratio)
Redemption Period: After which Purchase currency is returned to the aePool for collection by purchaser
Vesting Period: Time before all Deal Currency is released
Vesting Cliff: Time before Deal Currency begins vesting
Vesting curve: Initially linear but could be more complex in future versions

### Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)
<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
All variables will be configurable once Aelin governance is established by AELIN token holders.
